This is step by step introduction of how to create Docker containers for Node Exporter and Prometheus with Dockerfiles


First of all it is recommended to have separate directories for each service where we can keep Dockerfiles and necessary config files
For this task we need to have open the port 9090 of our VM from us

Then we need to create a docker network, and newly created containers should belong to that network.

docker network create prometheus-node

Then we have to pull my already created Docker images from the public repository

docker pull earzakantsyan/node-image:v1.0.1
docker pull earzakantsyan/prometheus-image:v1.0.1

For This task it is important to create the Node Exporter Container with name "node_exporter_instance", so the prometheus could recognize it by name 

docker run --name=node_exporter_instance -p 9100:9100 --network prometheus-node -d earzakantsyan/node-image:v1.0.1
docker run --name=prometheus_instance -p 9090:9090 --network prometheus-node -d earzakantsyan/prometheus-image:v1.0.1 


And that's it we can reach to our services by browsing [PUBLIC_IP:PORT]
