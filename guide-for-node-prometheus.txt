This is step by step introduction of how to create Docker containers for Node Exporter and Prometheus with Dockerfiles

Then we need to create a docker network, and newly created containers should belong to that network.

docker network create prometheus-node

then we need to create Dockerfiles, the content is pushed you can see them.

Then building images with their respective Dockerfiles and containers.
